/*
Returning Values From Block Expressions
========================================

if, match, functions, and scope blocks all have a unique
way of returning values in Rust.

If the last statement in an if, match, function, or scope
block is an expression without a ';' Rust will return it
as a value from the block. This is a great way to create
concise logic that returns a value that can be put into
a new variable.

Notice that it also allows an if statement to operate like
a concise ternary expression.

pub fn return_values_from_block_expressions() -> i32 {
    let x = 42;
    // Rust's ternary expression
    let v = if x < 42 { -1 } else { 1 };
    println!("from if: {}", v);

    //----

    let food = "hamburger";
    let result = match food {
        "hotdog" => "is hotdog",
        // notice the braces are optional when its just a single return expression
        _ => "is not hotdog",
    };
    println!("identifying food: {}", result);

    //----

    let v = {
        // This scope block lets us get a result without polluting function scope
        let a = 1;
        let b = 2;
        a + b
    };
    println!("from block: {}", v);
    // The idiomatic way to return a value in rust from a function at the end
    v + 4
}

fn main() {
    return_values_from_block_expressions();
}
