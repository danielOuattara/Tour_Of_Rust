Rust's for loop is a powerful upgrade. It iterates
over values from any expression that evaluates into
an iterator.

What's an iterator ? An iterator is an object that
you can ask the question "What's the next item you
have?" until there are no more items.

We'll explore this more in a future chapter. In the
meantime, just know Rust makes it easy to create
iterators that generate a sequence of integer numbers.

The .. operator creates an iterator that generates
numbers from a start number up to but not including
an end number.

The ..= operator creates an iterator that generates
numbers from a start number up to and including an end
number.

fn main() {
    for x in 0..5 {
        println!("{}", x);
    }

    println!("----");

    for x in 0..=5 {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    println!("-----------------------");
}
