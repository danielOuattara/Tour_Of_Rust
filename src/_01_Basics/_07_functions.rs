/*
Functions
==========

A function has zero or more parameters.
In this example, the add function takes two arguments
of type i32 (signed integer of 32-bit length).

If you just want to return an expression, you can drop
the return keyword and the semicolon at the end, as we
did in the subtract function.

Function names are always in snake_case.

Hint: if you define a function, the data it accepts are
called parameters. If you call that function and pass
data to it, then it's called arguments.

fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + y;
}

//---------------------------------------------

fn subtract(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}

//---------------------------------------------

pub fn main() {
    println!("42 + 13 = {}", add(42, 13));
    println!("42 - 13 = {}", subtract(42, 13));
    print!("-------------------------------\n");
}
